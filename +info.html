        On the other hand, it is celebrated on January 7 in other Orthodox Churches such as the Russian Orthodox Church or the Jerusalem Orthodox Church, which did not accept the reform made to the Julian calendar to move to the calendar known as Gregorian, a name derived from its reformer, the Pope. Gregory XIII. December 25 is a public holiday in many countries celebrated by millions of people around the world and also by large numbers of non-Christians. English speakers use the term Christmas, which means 'mass of Christ'. In some Germanic languages, such as German, the festival is called Weihnachten, which means 'consecrated night (s)'. The Christmas festivities are intended, as the name suggests, to celebrate the Nativity (that is, the birth) of Jesus of Nazareth. Christmas begins a period called the Christmas season, which ends with the solemnity of the Baptism of the Lord. Colloquially, the period that begins with Christmas and ends with the Epiphany of the Lord is also known as Easter. There are several theories about how Christmas was celebrated on December 25, which arise from different ways of investigating, according to some known data, on what date Jesus would have been born.

     <h2>History of Christmas</h2>
      <p>
       <h4>Formation of Christmas as a December holiday</h4>
      According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, Christmas is not included in Irenaeus' list of Christian holidays nor in Tertullian's list on the same subject, which are the oldest known lists. The earliest evidence of concern for the date of Christmas is found in Alexandria, around AD 200, when Clement of Alexandria indicates that certain "very curious" Egyptian theologians assign not only the year but also the actual day of the Christ's birth as 25 Coptic pashons (May 20) in the 28th year of Augustus. Since 221, in the work Chronographiai, Sexto Julio Africano popularized December 25 as the date of the birth of Jesus. By the time of the Council of Nicaea I in 325, the Alexandrian Church had already established the Díes nativitatis et epifaníae. Professor Shemarjahu Talmon, from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, investigated the passage from the Gospel of Saint Luke (1, 5-13) in which it is said that at the time when Herod was king of Judea, there was a priest named Zacharias , of the class of Abías, husband of Isabel. Luke says that "while Zacharias was officiating before the Lord, in the turn of his class, according to the custom of priestly service, he was drawn by lot to enter the temple to make the offering of incense" and at that moment an angel appeared to him. He predicted the birth of a son, who was to be called John, who would be the Baptist. The priests of ancient Israel were divided into 24 classes, which were organized in an order that did not vary and which had to perform liturgical service in the temple for a week, from Saturday to Saturday, twice a year. The class of Zacharias, that of Abijah, was the eighth in the official order. Talmon reconstructed the shifts with the help of the Qumran Essene community calendar. The second of the shifts was in September. The ancient Churches of the East celebrate the conception of John the Baptist between September 23 and 25. Saint Luke the Evangelist says that the Annunciation of the Archangel Saint Gabriel to the Virgin Mary happened six months after the conception of John the Baptist (Lk, 1, 26). The Eastern and Western liturgies agree on the identification of this date with the 31st of the month of Adar, which corresponds to our March 25, the date on which the Church celebrates the Annunciation and the conception of Jesus. The date of birth, therefore, should be placed 9 months later, that is, December 25.2 Some have objected that he could not be born in December, since the Gospel of Saint Luke speaks of some shepherds who spent the night at satin, which would indicate that it is not a winter season. However, the answer would be in the purity standards of Judaism. The flocks of sheep were differentiated into three types: those composed only of white wool sheep, considered pure and that after grazing returned to enter the fold in the center of the populations; those made up of sheep made of partly white and partly black wool, which in the afternoon entered pens arranged on the outskirts of the towns; and the black wool sheep, considered impure, that could not enter the cities or the sheepfolds, having to remain in the open with their shepherds at any time of the year. The Gospel also says that the shepherds took turns on watch, which would indicate a long, cold night, which fits in with a wintry context. The Pope of Rome used to celebrate three Christmas Masses. The first was around midnight in the Basilica of Santa María la Mayor, where according to tradition, the relics of the manger in which the Child Jesus was deposited are found. The high pontiff also celebrated mass for the Greek community of Rome in the Basilica of Santa Anastasia, perhaps in memory of the Anastasis or the Resurrection; which is called the Misa de la Aurora. The third mass was, finally, the one known as "diurnal", which the pope celebrated in St. Peter's Basilica, which was outside the Roman walls, for those who lived on the outskirts, essentially the rural population.

       <h4>Prohibition of the celebration of Christmas</h4>
       During the Protestant Reformation, the celebration of the birth of Christ was prohibited by some Protestant Churches, calling it "Traps of the Papists" and even "Claws of the beast", due to its relationship with Catholicism and ancient paganism. After the parliamentary victory against King Charles I during the English Civil War in 1647, the English Puritan rulers prohibited the celebration of Christmas. The town rebelled carrying out several riots until taking important cities like Canterbury, where they decorated the doors with slogans that spoke of the sanctity of the celebration. The Restoration of 1660 ended the ban, but many of the non-conforming Reform clergy rejected the Christmas celebrations, using Puritan arguments. In colonial America, New England Puritans rejected Christmas, and its celebration was outlawed in Boston from 1659 to 1681. At the same time, Christian residents of Virginia and New York freely followed the celebrations. Christmas fell out of favor in the United States after the Revolution, because it was considered an English custom. After the French Revolution, its own French republican calendar was developed. Although the changes in its implementation, 10 days a week, it was not very successful.

       <h4>Relationship with the 21st century</h4>
        At present, some independent Baptist churches, some non-traditional denominational paraprotestant congregations, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses whose founder is Charles Taze Russell, do not celebrate Christmas, because they consider it a "pagan holiday not prescribed in the Bible." In addition, they reject that December 25 is the true date of Christ's birth.24 25 It should be mentioned that, in its beginnings, Jehovah's Witnesses celebrated Christmas, not as a religious celebration, but as a form of socialization among its members. The change in attitude towards the holiday was due to the distinctive teachings of its religious leader, Judge Joseph Franklin Rutherford. Others, however, do not accept the tradition calling them anti-Christmas, some likening it to the attitudes of the Grinch.27 28 Some people have taken the holiday "unscientific" as shown in the Atheist Guide to Christmas. Bob Dorough made a song against the success that transcended White Christmas.

        <h4>Restoration</h4>
        By the 1820s, sectarian tensions in England had eased and some British writers began to worry, as Christmas was on the way out. Since they envisioned Christmas as a time of sincere celebration, they made efforts to revive the holiday. Charles Dickens's book A Christmas Carol, published in 1843, played an important role in reinventing the Christmas party, emphasizing family, goodwill, compassion, and family celebration. Christmas was declared a federal holiday in the United States in 1870, in law signed by President Ulysses S. Grant, but it is still a much-debated holiday by the various Puritan leaders of the nation.
